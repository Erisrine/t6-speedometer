# In Game Speedometer for T6
On screen speedometer for Black Ops II (T6) on Plutonium.
This is designed for zombies. It can and should work in any gamemode though.

# How to use.
Download the .gsc file and place it in C:\Users\YOUR_USER\AppData\Local\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\zm or \mp.
Plutonium should read the script upon starting a game. If the host has the script loaded, all players should get the speedometer.
